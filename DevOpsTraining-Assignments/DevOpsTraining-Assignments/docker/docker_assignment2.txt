Your company is ready to start using Docker on some of their servers. In order to get started, they want you to set up and configure Docker CE on a server that has already been set up. You will need to make sure that the server meets the following specifications:

Docker CE is installed and running on the server.
Use Docker CE version 5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic.
Any non-root user has permission to run docker commands.
The default logging driver is set to syslog.


[NOTE: Write the series of commands to achieve above in this file below the question scenario with documentation]


Good luck!

			SOLUTION STEPS	



1. First, update your existing list of packages:

	sudo apt update

2.Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS:
	sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

3.Then add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:

		curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
4.Add the Docker repository to APT sources:

		sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"

5. Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:

		sudo apt update
6. Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:

	apt-cache policy docker-ce

7.Finally, install Docker:

	sudo apt install docker-ce

8.Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that itâ€™s running:

		sudo systemctl status docker

9.If you want to avoid typing sudo whenever you run the docker command, add your username to the docker group:

	sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

  logout and login again to apply changes.
